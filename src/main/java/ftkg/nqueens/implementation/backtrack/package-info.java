/**
 * This module contains implementations for the N-Queen* problem using backtracking, and additional model classes.
 * <p>* with the additional constraint of no 3 queens forming straight lines
 * <p> The backtracking starts on the leftmost column and tries to place a queen iteratively in each column to the
 * right. If it fails, it backtracks, trying every configuration until it finds a solution (or no solution).
